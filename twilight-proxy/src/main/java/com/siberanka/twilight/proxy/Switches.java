/**
 * Bedrock server switches that need a pack reconnect, from the transfer until the player arrives. A switch
 * remembers where the player wants to go while the client reconnects, loads the pack and (on networks with a
 * login plugin) logs in again; it ends when the player is connected to that server, or at its deadline,
 * which grows with the size of the pack. Arrival is only taken from a connection that was established, never
 * from a connection request: login plugins may still change or refuse a request after every other listener.
 * Pure bookkeeping with an explicit clock, so it is tested without a proxy.
