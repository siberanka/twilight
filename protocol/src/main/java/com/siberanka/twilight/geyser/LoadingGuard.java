/**
 * Keeps a Bedrock player connected while the client is still loading its resource packs.
 *
 * <p>After the packs are downloaded, the Bedrock client builds them into its world (textures, models, fonts)
 * before it is in game; a large pack takes minutes on a phone. Geyser has already logged the player in to the
 * Java server by then. With Geyser's {@code forward-player-ping}, Java keep-alives and pings wait for the busy
 * client, so the Java server or the proxy drops the player ("Timed out", "read timed out"). Until the client reports that it is
 * in game, for at most {@code limit}, this answers them at once, as Geyser does without ping forwarding. It
 * also logs how long each client took and why one left while still loading, so a pack that is too heavy for
 * the players' devices shows in the console.
 *
 * <p>Without ping forwarding nothing is answered here: Geyser's protocol library already answers keep-alives
 * and Geyser answers pings itself, and a second answer makes Paper drop the player ("keepalive response
 * without matching challenge").
